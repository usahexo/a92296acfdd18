#  On what episode of Malcolm in the Middle do Malcolm and his family visit a Pharaoh casino?

This question has long been debated by Malcolm in the Middle fans. Some say that the family visits the Pharaoh casino in the episode titled “Forget Me Nots”, which aired on February 25, 2001. Others believe that they visit it in the episode “Graduation”, which aired on May 19, 2000.

Let’s take a closer look at both episodes to see if we can determine which one is correct.

In the episode “Forget Me Nots”, Malcolm and his family go to the Pharaoh casino after Lois breaks her ankle. They are initially excited about going, but they quickly become bored with it. This is evident when Malcolm complains that he has lost $8 and his mother says that she has lost $350.

In contrast, in the episode “Graduation”, Malcolm and his family go to the Pharaoh casino as part of their graduation celebration. They have a great time there and even manage to win some money.

Based on these differences, it seems more likely that the family visited the Pharaoh casino in the episode “Graduation” rather than “Forget Me Nots”.
