#  Ty Montgomery Leads Packers in Rushing; Adds New Number To the Team

In the week four matchup against the Buffalo Bills, Ty Montgomery led the Packers in rushing yards with 55. This is an impressive statistic, as the Bills are known for their strong defense. It was also a new number for Montgomery; he switched from wide receiver to running back this season, and number 88 is now retired by the Packers.

The Packers have had a running back by committee so far this season, with Montgomery, Jamaal Williams, and Aaron Jones all sharing playing time. Against the Bills, Montgomery had 15 rushes for 55 yards, Williams had 10 rushes for 34 yards, and Jones had two rushes for nine yards. The three players are evenly matched in terms of stats so far this season; Montgomery has 108 rushing yards on 25 carries, Williams has 97 rushing yards on 25 carries, and Jones has 95 rushing yards on 18 carries.

Montgomery's performance against Buffalo was praised by his teammates and coaches. "I thought Ty did an excellent job," said head coach Mike McCarthy. "He's a hell of a player." Wide receiver Jordy Nelson added: "He's been doing it all year. He's been making some big plays for us."

The Packers will need continued strong play from Montgomery as they enter the second half of their season. With one loss already suffered, they cannot afford another if they want to make the playoffs.

#  Rodgers Leads Green Bay to Victory in Season Opener

Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers offense looked in midseason form Sunday night, as they steamrolled the Chicago Bears 33-23 in the season opener at Lambeau Field. Rodgers completed 25 of his 38 passes for 286 yards and three touchdowns, including a 75-yard scoring strike to Geronimo Allison late in the fourth quarter that essentially put the game out of reach.

Chicago pulled to within six points midway through the fourth quarter on a pair of Mitchell Trubisky touchdown passes, but Rodgers answered right back with his long touchdown pass to Allison. The Packers defense also came up big, intercepting Trubisky twice and sacking him four times.

It was an impressive performance from Rodgers and the Packers, who are looking to make another run at the Super Bowl this season. With an explosive offense and a tough defense, Green Bay looks like one of the top contenders in the NFC.
