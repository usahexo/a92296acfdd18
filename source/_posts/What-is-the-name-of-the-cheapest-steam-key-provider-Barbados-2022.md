Steam is a digital distribution platform that offers digital rights management (DRM), multiplayer gaming, social networking services, and video streaming. It is used to distribute games and related media online, from small independent developers to larger software houses.

The current userbase for Steam exceeds 125 million active users. PC gamers rely on Steam to keep their game libraries up-to-date, as well as buy new games that they may have missed when they’re on sale. As part of Steamworks, developers also gain access to Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC), leaderboards, and other features to help them better manage their games. 

There are a number of ways you can buy games on Steam: you can purchase them outright, get them as part of a subscription service such as Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PlayStation Plus, or buy them using store credits or gift cards. However, the most popular way to buy games on Steam is by purchasing what are called “Steam keys”.

A Steam key is essentially a code that you enter into the Steam client in order to add a game to your library. This code can be bought from a variety of sources: online marketplaces such as G2A and Kinguin, through pre-order bonuses on certain websites like Humble Bundle, or directly from the developers themselves. 

When it comes to price, there is no one definitive answer - the cost of a Steam key depends on a variety of factors including the game itself, where you buy it from, and any sales or discounts that may be currently running. 

That said, we can take a look at some of the more popular providers of Steam keys and see how much they cost on average. The cheapest provider we could find was Barbados 2022, which charged an average price of $0.99 per key.

It is also important to remember that not all steam key providers are created equal and it can be worth doing some research before committing to a purchase. Some well-known and reputable providers include G2A, Kinguin and SteamKeysPro.

When comparing prices, it is also important to take into account the overall value of the game. For example, a game that is discounted by 50% may be cheaper than a game that is discounted by 10%. However, if the game is only discounted by 10% but includes multiple DLCs or other bonus content, it may be a better value overall.
