A little more than a year ago, I wrote about the possibility of l'auberge casino resort in Lake Charles, LA. At the time, there was an open house where people could go and look at the plans that were drawn up. At the time, it looked like things were moving forward with the project.

Now, it seems that nothing has happened with the project. There are no updates on their website and I can't find anything recent anywhere else on the Internet. I even reached out to them on Twitter and still haven't received a response.

So, what's going on with l'auberge casino resort? Are they still moving forward with the project? Has something happened that's preventing them from moving forward? I'm not sure, but I'm definitely curious to find out.

I'll continue to keep an eye on things and if I hear anything, I'll be sure to let you all know. In the meantime, if you have any information about what's happening with l'auberge casino resort, please let me know in the comments below.
